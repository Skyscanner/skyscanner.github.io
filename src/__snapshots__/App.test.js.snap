            We use Kubernetes a lot at Skyscanner. It’s great for running containerised workloads in a resilient, secure and cost-effective way.

            On top of contributing back to community tooling in the Kubernetes ecosystem, we've created several projects to help us improve our ways of working (

            Backpack is our design system. We like to describe it as the codification of design at Skyscanner. It’s a collection of design resources, reusable components and guidelines for creating our products with ease and consistency.
          </p>
          

          <p>
            Backpack empowers our people, giving them the tools to quickly deliver amazing work that’s on-brand, highly accessible and includes things like theming, RTL and dark mode support.
          </p>
          

          <p>
            Our design system supports four main platforms:

            </a>
             – so we’re able to build great experiences for every traveller, no matter which platform they’re using.

            We believe reliability and resilience across our services are of paramount importance. Retries (with configurable backoff), fallbacks and circuit breakers are just a few of the patterns we’ve adopted to achieve this. By sharing these back with the community, we can help fill the niche gaps where libraries implementing these patterns don't exist (
